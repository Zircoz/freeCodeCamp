# freeCodeCamp

This repo contains projects I made and make for freeCodeCamp.org .
Projects are segregated by the sections of freeCodeCamp, namely Responsive Design Projects, Javascript Algorithms and Data Structure Projects, Front End Libraries Projects, Data Visualization Projects, Apis and Microservices Projects, Information Security and Quality Assurance Projects.

The online working sample(s) of work will be provided wherever possible.

Suggestions and (constructive) criticism are always welcome!
Queries can be asked by creating 'issues' or contacting me on telegram: https://t.me/Zircoz
